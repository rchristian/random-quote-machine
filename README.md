This is a simple random quote machine built and then redesigned as part of FreeCodeCamp. You can click the "New Quote" button to get a new quote or the tweet button, which will let you tweet the current quote and author to your account if both are 140 characters or less.

To install, download the repo and install the necessary packages using npm. Start server.js using node or nodemon, then navigate to port 8080 on the localhost.

The API used is http://api.forismatic.com/api/1.0/?method=getQuote&format=json&lang=en
