This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.",

If the soul is left in darkness sins will be committed. The guilty one is not he who commits the sin, but he who causes the darkness.",
